# Local Community Event Portal

## Project Overview
The Local Community Event Portal is a web application designed to showcase upcoming local events, allow users to register, filter events by category or location, and interact dynamically with the portal. This project is built using HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript (ES6+), focusing on clean design, responsiveness, and rich functionality.

## Features
- Dynamic display of upcoming community events
- Registration form with input validation and user feedback
- Filtering events by category and location
- Event photo gallery with accessible alt text and captions
- Embedded promo video with JavaScript interaction
- Geolocation-based event search
- Responsive design with media queries for multiple devices
- Usage of modern JavaScript concepts: async/await, fetch API, closures, prototypes, and event handling

## Technology Stack
- *HTML5*: Semantic structure, forms, multimedia (video), tables, and accessibility features
- *CSS3*: External stylesheet with comments, selectors, box model, multi-columns, gradients, typography, and responsive media queries
- *JavaScript (ES6+)*: DOM manipulation, event handling, async data fetching, form validation, closures, prototypes, and modern syntax
- *Mock Data*: JSON file simulating backend API responses for events

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open index.html in your web browser directly or serve it via a local server (recommended for fetch API to work correctly).
3. Navigate through the portal to explore events, register, view galleries, and more.
4. The help.html page is accessible via the Help link for additional guidance.
