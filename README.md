## 🔷 Module Highlights

### ✅ Module 1 – HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript

This module is structured into a practical mini-project titled LocalCommunityEventPortal, which brings together concepts across all subtopics:

- HTML5 semantic layout, form validations, multimedia, and geolocation.
- CSS3 styling with responsiveness and layout control.
- JavaScript for interactivity, DOM manipulation, localStorage handling, and async fetch operations (JSON-based).

All code is modularized and well-commented for clarity and reusability.

### ✅ Module 1 – Bootstrap 5

Demonstrates use of Bootstrap 5 components for building responsive interfaces. It includes:

- Grid system layouts
- Navigation bars
- Forms, buttons, and utilities

### ✅ Module 2 – ANSI SQL

Includes SQL scripts written using ANSI-compliant syntax:
- Table creation and modification (DDL)
- Data insertion, filtering, joins, grouping, and subqueries (DML)
- Hands-on with constraints, aggregate functions, and sorting logic

Tested using MySQL on WAMP Server.

### ✅ Module 3 – Core Java

Contains core Java programs and exercises that cover:
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Collections and control structures
- File I/O and exception handling
- Basic CLI utilities and logic implementations

All exercises are structured for clarity and follow Java best practices.
